# Restaurant_Sentiment_Analysis

#Introduction:-----
Most of the Restaurants ask reviews to the customers and based on the reviews the restaurant can improve the customer satisfaction. So Reviews plays a vital role for the successful growth of the restaurant.

#Problem Statement:-----
Restaurant owners need to know if they're getting good reviews based on the comments they receive, as it can be difficult to go through each comment and classify whether or not it gives a good review. Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows us to address this particular issue by making such predictions if commenters leave a good review or not.
